> toCKB is under active development and considered to be a work in progress.

toCKB maps assets on other blockchains to [CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) in a trustless way.

At this stage, we are focusing on [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum).
